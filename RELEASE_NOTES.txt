RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.1.2
--------------------------------

The Bismark output files for single-end and paired-end reads have been
modified so that they contain only vital information, thereby reducing 
their file size and confusion. More details on the output format can be
found at http://seqanswers.com/wiki/Custom_Bismark_output_format or in
the README.txt. 

Both Bismark and the Methylation Extractor now write out their version
info into the first line of their output files so it is easier to track
errors.

Reads aligning to the very edges of chromosomes previously produced
several error messages when trying to extract one additional bp to 
determine if Cs are in CpG context. These reads (which are very few in
in the datasets tested so far) will now be excluded from the methylation
call analysis.


RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.1.1
--------------------------------

Both the Bismark genome preparation as well as Bismark itself should
now also run with genome FASTA files that do not look like Ensembl
files (i.e. chr1.fa,chr.2.fa or similar will be fine, too). For the 
moment it is still required however that the files end on '.fa' and 
only one sequence entry is allowed per file. (Multiple fasta entries 
per file will be supported soon). 


RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.1
------------------------------

Bismark v0.1 is an initial beta release and as such is still a
work in progress.

We have successfully used Bismark for bisulfite mapping against
various genomes (mouse NCBIM37, human NCBI36 and GRCh37, and Yeast 
SGD1.01). In our tests the code appears to be working as expected.

We have initially designed Bismark to support the kinds of analyses
we require, thus if you have some ideas or suggestions which could
be implemented please let us know.
